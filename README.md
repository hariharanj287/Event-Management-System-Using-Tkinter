# Event Management System Using Tkinter
The Event Management System is a desktop application developed using Python, with Tkinter for the graphical user interface and MySQL as the backend database. The primary goal of this system is to streamline the process of managing events and handling user registrations. The system features an admin panel that allows administrators to log in, add new events, and delete existing ones. Admins can also view detailed information about registered users, including the total number of registrations for each event, all of which is displayed dynamically. Users, on the other hand, can register for available events by providing their personal details such as name, age, gender, city, and email. Upon successful registration, a confirmation email is sent to the users through an SMTP service, ensuring smooth communication.

The application integrates seamlessly with a MySQL database, where all event and user data are securely stored, enabling efficient data management and scalability. The interface dynamically displays event lists and user registrations, and the admin can easily search for users by name using a built-in search bar. This system is designed to reduce manual intervention in event management processes while improving user engagement and interaction. Future enhancements will include password encryption for admin login, advanced event filtering options, and UI improvements to give the application a more modern look and feel.
